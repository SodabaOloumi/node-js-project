# Node js Project

Application course is designed to provide a seamless learning experience for both professors and students. The backend of the course is powered by NodeJS, ensuring efficient and reliable performance. On the frontend, we have utilized a carefully crafted Bootstrap template, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

The application course caters to three types of users: admin, professor, and student. The admin user plays a crucial role in managing the system. They have the authority to register both professors and students, ensuring that only authorized individuals gain access to the course materials.

Professors, on the other hand, are given the privilege to add their courses to the platform. This allows them to easily organize their teaching materials and share them with their students. Professors can upload lecture notes, assignments, and any other relevant resources for their courses.

Students are granted access to these registered courses. They can browse through the available materials uploaded by their respective professors. This enables them to stay updated with course content and refer back to important resources whenever needed.

3: Professors can view thier courses, add lessons and set thier profiles.
